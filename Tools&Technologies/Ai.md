# 🤖 AI for Full Stack Developers

You must know how to utilize ai in your projects and your work 

---

## 🔹 1. AI Fundamentals (Optional but Useful)

Basic understanding of core concepts:

- Machine Learning vs Deep Learning
- Key ML algorithms:
  - Linear Regression
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Decision Trees
  - Clustering (K-Means)
- What is NLP (Natural Language Processing)
- Introduction to LLMs (Large Language Models)
  - GPT (OpenAI)
  - Gemini (Google)
  - Claude (Anthropic)

**Popular Libraries:**
- `scikit-learn` – traditional ML
- `TensorFlow`, `PyTorch` – deep learning
- `Transformers` (HuggingFace) – NLP & LLMs

## 🔹 2. Using AI APIs in Your Apps (Highly Practical)

> As a full-stack developer, your main strength is integration — you don’t need to build AI models, but you can use them creatively.

### 🌐 Frontend Integration
Use APIs from:
- OpenAI (ChatGPT, DALL·E)
- HuggingFace (transformer models)
- Cohere (text generation and classification)

### 📦 Example Use-Cases
- AI chatbots using GPT
- AI-generated text and image content
- Smart search/autocomplete
- AI-powered resume analyzer

---

## 🔹 3. Prompt Engineering (Must-Have Skill for AI Use)

Learn to write prompts that get the best output from AI models.

### 🧠 Prompting Skills
- Role prompting & system messages
- Few-shot prompting (giving examples)
- Function calling (OpenAI functions)
- Tool usage via agents

### 🖼️ Image Generation Prompts
- DALL·E
- Midjourney
- Stable Diffusion

## 🔹 4. AI Tools for Developers (Optional but Helpful)

Helpful tools and services to integrate advanced AI features:

- **LangChain (Python/JS):** Build AI agents and chains
- **Vector Databases:**
  - Pinecone
  - Weaviate
  - ChromaDB
- **Speech Recognition:**
  - Whisper (speech-to-text)
- **Model Hosting/Serving:**
  - Replicate
  - HuggingFace Inference Endpoints
